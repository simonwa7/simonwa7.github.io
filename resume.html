<h3 class="indent">Career Objective</h3>
<p class="indent"> I am currently a Junior at Tufts University, pursuing a major in Chemical Physics and a concentration in Computer Science at the school of Arts and Sciences. The majority of my coursework deals specifically with understanding and modeling complex atomic behavior, as well as data manipulation through the use of C++ data structures. I plan to use my knowledge of quantum mechanics, atomic behavior, and programming logic to advance technology in the materials science, programming, environmental science, and clean energy fields. </p>
